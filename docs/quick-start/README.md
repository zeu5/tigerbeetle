# Quickstart

First, get TigerBeetle running:

* [Run a single-node cluster with a single binary](./single-binary.md)
* Or [run a three-node cluster with a single binary](./single-binary-three.md)
* Or [run a single-node cluster with Docker](./with-docker.md)
* Or [run a three-node cluster with docker-compose](./with-docker-compose.md)

Then, try creating accounts and transfers [using the TigerBeetle CLI](./cli-client.md).
